Probelm provided a zip file consisting 1463 files all of same size 512 bytes. by inspection all the files looked like they came from fragmentation of a binary file. I wrote a python script to combine all the files and then I ran the combined binary file.

```python
import os

# Get a list of all files in the current directory
files = [f for f in os.listdir() if os.path.isfile(f)]
print(files)
# # Filter files based on size, adjust the condition as per your need
files_to_combine = [f for f in files if os.path.getsize(f) == 512]  # 512 KB

# Open the combined file in binary mode
with open('combined_file', 'wb') as combined:
    # Concatenate each file into the combined file
    for file_name in files_to_combine:
        with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:
            combined.write(f.read())

```
the binary files asked for password. 
I used the strings command in terminal to extract all the strings from the binary file. I found the flag in the strings. 
```bash
strings ./combined_file  | grep HRCTF
```

Flag: HRCTF{7h15_15_63771n6_r3p17171v3}
